Use the following steps to setup Bluetooth audio on your Retropie system. This is useful in scenarios where an audio jack is not available such as various Pi Zero builds. This process is still a work in progress and will be updated as new information comes in. The goal here was to simplify the steps by utilizing bash shells to install packages, edit configs, and start the needed services. The methods outlined below will require terminal access to the physical system or an SSH session. The scripts take care of the majority of the setup, however the last steps do require manual interaction to identify and pair the bluetooth device you want to utilize. This method allows for the pairing of multiple devices, just ensure you only have the one you wish to pair powered up when you power on your Pi.
