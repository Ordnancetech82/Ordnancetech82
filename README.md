# Pi_BTAudio_Tutorial
Bluetooth Audio Setup for Raspberry Pi

This is the method I used for enabling Bluetooth audio on a RPi Zero W running Retropie 4.6 (buster). The steps outlined were sourced from several online tutorials and while each one didn’t comprehensively address enabling audio, the info from each tutorial was reconstructed after some trial and error. This has been tested multiple times to ensure the accuracy and consistency of these steps. This is applicable where standard audio output isn’t practical and Bluetooth is preferred.
